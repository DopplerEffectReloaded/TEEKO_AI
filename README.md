# TEEKO_AI
This repository contains an AI player for the board game TEEKO.

## Usage Instructions
This is done using no external libraries or imports, you simply need to have python installed. This was tested on python version 3.12.
Simply run using python game.py to launch the game up in your terminal.

## Future development
May integrate pygame into this, to create an actual TEEKO board, and place whatever decisions the AI makes into the pygame window.
